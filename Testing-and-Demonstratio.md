# Testing and Demonstration Plan

This document outlines the testing procedures and demonstration plan for our JIRA Service Desk implementation.

## 1. Test User Creation

| User Type | Username | Role |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Admin | admin_user | JIRA Administrator |
| IT Support | support_user | Service Desk Team |
| Employee | employee_user | Customer |

## 2. Scenario Testing

### Scenario 1: Submit and Resolve a Ticket
1. Log in as employee_user
2. Create a new "Software Problem" ticket
3. Log in as support_user
4. Pick up the ticket, update status
5. Resolve the ticket
6. Log in as employee_user
7. Verify and close the ticket

### Scenario 2: Hardware Request Process
1. Log in as employee_user
2. Submit a "Hardware Request" for a new laptop
3. Log in as admin_user
4. Review and approve the request
5. Update the request status through each stage of the workflow

### Scenario 3: New Hire Onboarding
1. Log in as admin_user
2. Create a "New Hire Onboarding" ticket
3. Verify creation of all subtasks
4. Complete each subtask
5. Verify successful workflow completion

## 3. Automation Rule Testing

| Rule Name | Trigger | Expected Outcome |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Auto-assign Priority | Create high-priority ticket | Priority set to High |
| SLA Breach Notification | Approach SLA breach | Email sent to team lead |
| Auto-Categorize Hardware | Create hardware request | Correct component set |

## 4. Workflow Verification

- Verify all transitions in IT Support Workflow
- Test approval process in Hardware Request Workflow
- Ensure all stages of User Onboarding Workflow function correctly

## 5. Reporting and Dashboard Verification

- Check all gadgets on IT Support Overview dashboard
- Run and verify each custom report
- Ensure automated reports are generated and sent correctly

## 6. Performance Testing

- Tool: Apache JMeter
- Test Scenario: Simulate 50 concurrent users submitting tickets
- Monitor: CPU usage, Memory usage, Response times
- Acceptance Criteria: < 3 seconds response time for 95% of requests

## 7. Security Testing

- Verify role-based access controls
- Test SSL/TLS configuration
- Perform basic penetration testing (e.g., SQL injection attempts)

## 8. Backup and Restore Test

1. Perform full system backup
2. Set up a separate test environment
3. Restore backup to test environment
4. Verify data integrity and system functionality

## 9. Demonstration Video Outline

1. Introduction to the JIRA Service Desk setup (30 seconds)
2. Walkthrough of user interfaces for each role (1 minute)
3. Demonstration of ticket lifecycle (2 minutes)
4. Showcase of custom workflows (1 minute)
5. Highlight key automation rules (1 minute)
6. Overview of reporting and dashboards (1 minute)
7. Conclusion and key benefits (30 seconds)

Total video length: Approximately 7 minutes

## 10. Test Results Documentation

- Compile results from all test scenarios
- Document any issues encountered and their resolutions
- Prepare summary report of system performance and reliability
- Include screenshots of key features and custom configurations
