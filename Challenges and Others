# Challenges and Solutions

This document outlines key challenges faced during the JIRA Service Desk virtual lab implementation and how they were addressed.

## 1. Limited System Resources

**Challenge:** The virtual machine was initially slow to respond due to limited allocated resources.

**Solution:** Increased VM RAM from 2GB to 4GB and added an additional virtual CPU core. This significantly improved JIRA's performance.

## 2. Email Integration Complexity

**Challenge:** Setting up a functioning email integration for ticket creation and updates in a lab environment.

**Solution:** Utilized Postfix as a local SMTP server and configured JIRA to use it. Created a catch-all email address for testing various email-to-ticket scenarios.

## Lessons Learned

1. Always start with more system resources than you think you'll need. It's easier to scale down than to troubleshoot performance issues.
2. Use simplified, local solutions for complex integrations in a lab environment. This allows focus on core functionality without external dependencies.
3. Thorough documentation of the setup process is crucial. It helps in troubleshooting and serves as a valuable resource for future reference or when explaining the project to others.
